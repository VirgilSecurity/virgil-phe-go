### Workflow

Copy this checklist and check off items as you complete them:

```
Task Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Understand the current state of the project
- [ ] Step 2: Check the documentation
- [ ] Step 3: Help refine the idea/feature
- [ ] Step 4: Describe the design
- [ ] Step 5: Document the design
- [ ] Step 6: Create the task list
```

**Step 1: Understand the current state of the project**

To properly refine the idea into a fully-formed design you need to **understand the existing code** in our working directory to know where we're starting off.

**Step 2: Check the documentation**

In order to gain a better understanding of the project, **check the contributing guidelines and any relevant documentation**. For example, take a look at `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `docs` directory.

**Step 3: Help refine the idea/feature**

Once you've become familiar with the project and code, you can start asking me questions, one at a time, to **help refine the idea**.

Ideally, the questions would be multiple choice, but open-ended questions are OK too.

Don't forget: only one question per message!

**Step 4: Describe the design**

Once you believe you understand what we're trying to achieve, stop and **describe the whole design** to me, **in sections of 200-300 words at a time**, **asking after each section whether it looks right so far**.

**Step 5: Document the design**

Document in .md files the entire design and write a comprehensive implementation plan.

Feel free to break out the design/implementation documents into multi-part files, if necessary.

When creating documentation, follow this approach:

- IF this is this a completely new feature - document it in in `/docs/wip/[feature-title]/{design,implementation}.md`.
- ELSE this an improvement or an addition to an existing feature:
  - If the feature is still WIP (documented under `/docs/wip`) - ask the user if you should update the existing design/implementation documents, or create new ones in a sub-directory of the existing feature.
  - Else the feature is completed (documented under root of `/docs`) - create new design/implementation documents in a sub-directory of the existing feature.

**When documenting design and implementation plan**:

- Assume the developer who is going to implement the feature is an experienced and highly-skilled %LANGUAGE% developer, but has zero context for our codebase, and knows almost nothing about our problem domain. Basically - a first-time contributor with a lot of programming experience in %LANGUAGE%.
- **Document everything the developer may need to know**: which files to touch for each task, code structure to be aware of, testing approaches, any potential docs they might need to check. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks.
- **Make sure the plan is unambiguous, detailed and comprehensive** so the developer can adhere to DRY, YAGNI, TDD, atomic/self-contained commits principles when following this plan.

But, of course, **DO NOT:**

- **DO NOT add complete code examples**. The documentation should be a guideline that gives the developer all the information they may need when writing the actual code, not copy-paste code chunks.
- **DO NOT add commit message templates** to tasks, that the developer should use when committing the changes.
- **DO NOT add other small, generic details that do not bring value** and/or are not specifically relevant to this particular feature. For example, adding something like "to run tests, execute: 'go test ./...'" to a task does not bring value. Remember, the developer is experienced and skilled!

**Step 6: Create the task list**

Based on the implementation plan documented in Step 5, create a `tasks.md` file in the same `/docs/wip/[feature-title]/` directory.

Follow the structure and conventions in the [example task file](./example-tasks.md). Key points:

- **Header metadata** links back to design/implementation docs and tracks overall feature status
- **One H2 per task** with status, dependencies, and a link to the relevant docs section
- **Checkbox subtasks** are concrete, actionable implementation steps — specific enough that a developer with no project context can follow them
- **Subtask descriptions** name the file/function/component being touched and what to do with it — not vague ("implement auth") but precise ("create `internal/auth/token.go` with `GenerateToken` and `ValidateToken` functions")
- **Dependencies** reference other tasks by number when ordering matters
- **Status values:** `pending`, `in-progress`, `done`, `blocked` (with reason)
- Tasks should map roughly 1:1 to atomic, self-contained commits
- **Always include a final verification task** that depends on all other tasks — it should invoke `testing-process` to run the full test suite and `documentation-process` to update any relevant docs
